# CarWorkshop - A Car Workshop Management App

CarWorkshop is a cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter that helps manage car service bookings for a workshop. The app includes user authentication, role-based access (admin/mechanic), and a calendar view for tracking car service bookings. Admins can create and manage bookings, while mechanics can view jobs assigned to them.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Real-time data syncing with Firebase Firestore.
- **Responsive UI**: Adaptable to different screen sizes.
